# 🔐 Wi-Fi Attack Automation Tool

This tool is a Python-based utility that automates the process of Wi-Fi network penetration testing, including handshake capture, password cracking, DoS attacks, and password list generation. It acts as a wrapper around powerful tools like `aircrack-ng`, `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, `crunch`, and `wireshark`.

⚠️ **Educational Purposes Only**
This tool is intended for security professionals and researchers on networks they own or are authorized to audit. Unauthorized access or attacks on networks are illegal and unethical.

## 🚀 Features

* Scan for Access Points and capture detailed information.
* Detect and lock on target network channels.
* Capture WPA/WPA2 handshakes.
* Launch deauthentication (DoS) attacks.
* Crack captured handshakes using a wordlist or custom-generated passwords.
* Generate password lists with custom masks using `crunch`.
* Launch Wireshark for EAPOL packet inspection.
* Interactive terminal-based menu interface.

## 🧰 Requirements

Ensure the following are installed:

* Python 3.x
* Linux OS with `aircrack-ng`, `crunch`, and `wireshark`
* GNOME Terminal
* `nmcli` (NetworkManager CLI)

Install dependencies on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng crunch wireshark network-manager
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyb2rS2c/Wi-Fi_ATTACK.git
cd Wi-Fi_ATTACK
```

### 2. Run the Tool

```bash
sudo python3 wifi_cracker.py 
```

Root privileges are required for most network interface operations.

### 3. Follow the Menu

Interactive options guide you through:

```
Welcome to the Attack Menu
1. Find Channel /run it second
2. Capture Handshake
3. Denial of Service (DoS)
4. Crack Handshake
5. Generate Password List
6. Restart Network Manager/ ensure this is up before executing 00
00. Find info about AP /run it first
001. See EAPOL in Wireshark
0. Exit
```

---

## ✨ Example Flow

1. Select **00** to list available APs.
2. Select **1** to lock onto a specific channel.
3. Select **2** to capture the handshake.
4. Select **3** to deauth clients and force reconnection.
5. Select **4** to crack the captured handshake.
6. Optionally use **5** to generate a custom wordlist if one is not available.
